            <h2 >What is A.I</h2>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. They can do many things humans may not achieve anytime soon. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match full human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, voice or handwriting recognition, and chatbots.</p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.hxeyVhDb_Rc7lBBdruaw5AHaFj?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" alt="">

    <section id="Origins"><div><h2>Origins</h2><p>In the 1940s and 50s, a handful of scientists from a variety of fields (mathematics, psychology, engineering, economics and political science) began to discuss the possibility of creating an artificial brain. The field of artificial intelligence research was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.[52]The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College, USA during the summer of 1956.[1] Those who attended would become the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them predicted that a machine as intelligent as a human being would exist in no more than a generation, and they were given millions of dollars to make this vision come true.[2]</p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.Lck8bpYINnw3-xR0Ls7OxwHaD4?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" alt=""></div></section>
    <section id="struggles"><div><h2>Struggles</h2><p>Eventually, it became obvious that commercial developers and researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project.[3] In 1974, in response to the criticism from James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from congress, the U.S. and British Governments stopped funding undirected research into artificial intelligence, and the difficult years that followed would later be known as an "AI winter". Seven years later, a visionary initiative by the Japanese Government inspired governments and industry to provide AI with billions of dollars, but by the late 1980s the investors became disillusioned and withdrew funding again.</p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.99a9b2cfb74d3665edb4bfe847e092f0?rik=L1v%2fvUbDDN7c1A&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" alt="" id="big"></div></section>
